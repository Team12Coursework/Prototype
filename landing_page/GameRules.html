        <h2>Game Rules</h2> 
        <h3> Rule 1 :</h3>
  <p>The first player combines two or more of their letters to form a word and places it on the board to read either across or down with one letter on the center square. Diagonal words are not allowed.</p>
  <h3> Rule 2 :</h3>
  <p>When your turn is completed you will see your score for that turn. Then automatically you will draw as many new letters as you played; you will always have seven letters on your rack, if there are enough letters left.</p>
  <h3> Rule 3 :</h3>
  <p>Play passes to the left. The second player, and then each in turn, adds one or more letters to those already played to form new words. All letters played on a turn must be placed in one row across or down the board, to form at least one complete word. If, at the same time, they touch other letters in adjacent rows, those must also form complete words, like in a crossword, with all such letters. The player gets full credit for all words formed or modified on his or her turn.</p>
   <h3> Rule 4 :</h3>
<p>New words may be formed by adding one or more letters to a word or letters already on the board.Adding a word at right angles to a word already on the board. The new word must use one of the letters already on the board or must add a letter to it.</p>
<h3>Rule 5 :</h3>
<p> No letter can be changed after it has been played and scored. </p>
<h3>Rule 6 :</h3>
<p> Blanks: The two blank tiles may be used as any letters. When playing a blank, you must choose which letter it represents. It remains that letter for the rest of the game.</p>
<h3>Rule 7 :</h3>
<p>You may use a turn to exchange all, some, or none of the letters. To do this, place your discarded letter(s) facedown. Draw the same number of letters from the pool, then mix your discarded letter(s) into the pool. This ends your turn. </p>
<h3>Rule 8 : </h3>
<p>The game ends when all letters have been drawn and one player uses his or her last letter; or when all possible plays have been made.</p>
