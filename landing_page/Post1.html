  <h1>Greetings to all everyone who is currently reading this blog, Team 12 would like to thank you for all your support. We’d first like to introduce you to our website you are currently reading on.</h1>

    <h2>About the game</h2>
    <img src="Post1.png" width= "800" height= "300">

    <p>The landing page was designed to be simple and intuitive to use, containing everything they need to jump straight into a game. As of right now, the game has not been implemented into the website, as the core functionality is still in development. However, we’re eagerly working on creating an alpha version of the game for our players to test in one months’ time.</p>

<div class="some-container">
    <h2>Header</h2>
    <img src="Images/Header.png" width= "800" height= "300">
    <p>The header is kept minimalistic for a clean look, so it won’t disturb players during gameplay. Players will be able to sign in or register for an account upon the full release, as well as manage their profile, and settings. </p>
 
</div>
<div class="some-container">
    <h2>Footer</h2>
    <img src="Images/Footer.png" width= "800" height= "300">
    <p> We’d like to draw your attention to the footer, which will contain all navigational aspects and other necessary information our players may need. Rather than explaining the contents of each webpage, we think it’s better for our players to experience it for themselves. Our socials are also included, so if you’d like to be notified on any updates or upcoming events, please feel free to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram - we appreciate your support.</p>
